throughout the book on fly leaves and in blank spaces in
the ordinary current hand of the period.

Among the collectione of manuscript in the library of
the British Museum, the Bodleian, and elsewhere, there
are other cartularies oi Malmesbury, which contain most
of the charters printed here, besides some of a later date
than any ol those in the copy in the Public Reoord
Offioe.

Lansdowne MS. 417, in the British Museumt-llhis
volume, according to a note by Dr. Ducarel on the fly
leni, was in the possession of J ames West, Esq, in 1763.
The bulk oi the volume is contained in the Reoord Office
Cartulary, but there area few additional documento at
the end. The descriptione of the documento in the table of
contente are not copied ⁸from that in the R Ο. MS, but
have been independently made, andjcontain a few erroro,
such as Portam Lcmrordi for Pontem. This error,
however, is not repeated in tha text Many oi the names

also are spelt in rather a more modern form than in tha
R. Ο. Oartulary, as Wotton for wodeton, andin one
place² what is merely a marginal note in the R. Ο. MS.
is here incorporated into the rubrio.

The leaves of the table of contenta arc put in wrong
order. On a blank space at the loot of what isnowf. 4
thereis a sketch of the Virgin and Ohild The fonnersits
on a throne, crowned and nimbed‚ with afloriated sceptra
in her left hand, and the Holy Child on her right arm.
He is almost nude, having his lestarm round his mother’s
neck, andan appla or ball in his right hand. A cruci-
fonn nimbus is on his head. This, with the appla, and
the Virgin’s crown‚ morse, and the lining of her robe are
touched up with red. On the other side of the earne
leaf are two spirited sketches ofa lion and a gryphon,
heraldically treated. The papal names and mottoes at
the end of the bulls are not copied in this MS. as in
the R Ο.

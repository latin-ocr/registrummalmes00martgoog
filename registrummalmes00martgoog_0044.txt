One of the oppurtenenoes to the ebbey mentioned here
is the vineysrd. We are told by William of Malmesbury,
in his Life of St. Aldhelm‚² that vines were originally
planted on a hill to the north of the abbey, perhaps on
the slope on the fer side of Newnton Weber, by one Con·
stantius, a Greek monk‚ who took refuge there for several
years, somewhere about the year 103011). His true
name and dignity were never known, but that he wes an
archbishop was conjectured from his attiring himself in
1 pall just before his death, and that he was a 111111 of no
common holiness was proved by the whiteness and
pleasant smell of his boues when his grave wes disturbed
some years afterwards The plents which the stranger
tended so earefully‚ to remind him in our foggy obmate of
the suunier skies and richer vegetation of his home, must
have long been dead, for the chronicler speaks of them
es lasting for some years, implying thet they had not
continued until his time. The vineyard that was in
existence when this manuscript was compiled was no
doubt the new one just planted by Abbot William
coleres? whose care for the improvement of the ebbey
and its property appears from a detsiled account of the
works done by his order inserted in the beginning of the
certulary. The frequent references to vineyurds in this
island in early times coupled with the difficulty of
getting grapes to ripen properly in the open air, has led

some writers to suggest that the word vineyard was'

applied to eny orchard of fruit trees used for making
drink, suches apples gooseberries or surrants.³ Here
vineoe, pomerio, ond gardinum are cleerly distinet Itis
possible that the object of planting 1 vineyard may have
been to provide 1 supply of wine for the Holy Commu-
niou‚ eta time when rosds wore bad and importation

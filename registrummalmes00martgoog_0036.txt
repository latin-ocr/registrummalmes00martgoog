and 82 b..-120) of this cartulary is written in cheud
very similer to thet employed iu the R. Ο. and Lans-

smaller and closer, and less omamental The first
seven leaves evidently donet belong to it at sll, and,
according to the Oetalogue of Additional MSS. in the
British Moesum, “ have formed part apparently of
“ another register‚ of which a portion isin the library
“ of Sir Thos. Phillipps.'' The titles of the chortem are
not always in the seme words as iu the R. Ο. MS,
and as iar as Gap. CLXXVI. the names of the witnesses

the table of contente of the R. Ο. MS. as (lap. XL,
,but is not in the text, is given in this volume. It also
supplies a few words omitted in Cap. OOCCXLIX, R 0.,
which should reud as follows, beginning at line 9,
“Scilicet medietatem collorum et esclenkerum boum et
“medietatem collorum multonum et medietatem col-
“ lorum et caudarum eschinerum porcorum,'’ so that
the eook's rightful perquisites were slightly curtailed
if the faulty copy was taken es authentis.

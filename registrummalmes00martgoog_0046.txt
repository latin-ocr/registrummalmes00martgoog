68001111 081. Τ11011 follow 001101 granta by Saxon kings,
30 in all. The whole of them have been printed from
ι the Lansdowne MS. by Kemhle in his Codex Diploma·

tiens, with the exception 01 Athelstan's grant 01Β1011111111,1
whichis omitted in the Lansdowne manuscript hythe
carelessness 01 0110 transcriber, owing to the preamhles of
this and the succeeding charter being alike.

For Edward the Confessor’s confirmation, Kemble does
refer to the R. O. MS. and also to Harl. MS. 6748, which is
merelya collection 0111100010 copisa, but 0110 remainder are
printed by him solely from the Lansdowne MS. A few
have also been printed hy Sir Thos. Phillipps as already
mentioned. In Cap. XL. Kemble inserts the boundaries
01 10οο1101110, which do not occur in the charter itself‚
but are found in Lansd. MS. 417, Cap. XXX„ among the
boundaries 01 001101 manors. It will be seen by 0 glanoe
at Edward the Confessor’s confirmation that the effect
01 those granta was to endow the ahbey with nearly 300
hides of land, which must have amounted to over 70,000
statute aeres, 11 Μ1. Eyton's calculatione 01 0110 average
extent 01 0110 hide in other counties holds good also for
Wiltshire.2 The whole 01 01110 property was again con·
firmed to them after the Conquest by William Ι. 00
his Queen’s request. ’1110 same king also conferred upon
0110 convent the right 01 holding-a 1011 101 10111 days next
to the 10000 01 St. 01011011οῑ (May 25), which was subse·
quently extended to eight days by Matilda the Queen 01
Henry Ι. In the last years 01. 0110 abbey’s existence this
1011 had become οο popular that, as Leland tells us, the
town kept 0 band 01 0111100 111011 to 000 the peace kept,
“ and this 10 0110 01 0110 bra-gges 01 0110 001111, 0110 therby '

PREFACE. XXV

of the same artistic excellence, those between ff. 28
and 12«) being executed with much less teste and
skill than are displayed in other portione of the MS.
These leaves, however, as will he seen by examining
the signatores, were inserted after the rest oi the book
was written.

Some of the larger capital letters, as, for instance, the
capital H oi Gap. I.‚ are wrought with very great deli-
· racy and precision of hand. The lists of witnesses also
to the Saxon chartam, the lines os which begin elter-

a sketch of a head witha buttoned ,hood and cap tied

other drawing, in the initial P of the Statutes of Win-
cheste'r (Gap. V. i. 64), represents a king enthroned and ’
erowned, clad in a yellow tunic and a red robe. His
hair and short bcard are red. His right hand holds a
sword, while his left is uplifted in an attitude of com·

text of the chartcrs implicitly. The scribe probably

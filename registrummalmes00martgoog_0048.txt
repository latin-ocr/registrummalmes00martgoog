Nicholas 11, in the thirteenth, conferred on the convent
important and extensive privileges. The first papal bull
entered in this Registen that 01 Sergius 1.,¹ exempta the
convent from episcopal jurisdiction, and confers upon
them freedom 01 electiori In addition to these rights,
bishops and other clerks are forbidden to celebrate
mass in the abbey chmoh without the permission 01 the
,officere or to extort gifts even for ordaining one 01 the
society. It will be noticed that there is no mention
here 01 the Benedictine rule, to which Mslmesbury,
in common with other abbeys, conformed at a latter
period. Sergius merely exhorts the monks in general
terms to observa the spiritual mandates of holy fathers,
and impressas on them as their duties, praise and prayer,
hospitality and study. In the letter of soumarias? which
is 01 about the same period, the vagus phrase rwrnao
sonctce repuloeis used, and it is not until the bull 01
Innocent 11, in 1142, that the rule 01 St. Benedict is
distinctly mentioned. Originally Maildulph’s founda-
tion doubtless followed the rule 01 St. Columba, and it

was not until the reforms 01 Eadgar and Dunstan³ that .

the stricter Italian rulo was enforeed and observed.

The name 01 the abbey also underwent some changes
during the first centurias of its existence. At first it is
merely entitled the family of Christ in the monastery of
Malmeshury. In 850 St. Peter was adopted as the
patron saint, but the church was still called the church
of the Savioun In 974, after King Eadgsr’s reforma,
the names 01 Christ and his Mother‚ the Apostles Peter
and Paul, and St. Aldhelm are all connected with the
foundation. Innocent II. states in his bull that the
church was originally founded in honour 01 the two
Apostles, and on its rebuilding dedicated to the Virgin
and St. Aldhelm, but it does not appear elsewhere that
the name of Paul was attached to it before that 01 St

Aldhelm.

These volumen coutsin me historical vorke ol Gerald du Barry, who lived
in the reigna of Henry IL, Richard1., and John, and attempted to re·establiah
the independenca oi wales by rauouug the sae oi St. Davida to its ancient
primacy. llis vorke are of a very miscellaneam nature, both in prose and
verse, and are remarkable chiefly for the racy and original anecdotes which
they coutain relating to contemporaries. He is the only Welrh writer οἱ any
importante who has contributed so much to the meditevnl literature of this
country, or assumed, in consequence of hia nationality‚ so free and independent
atoue. isra frequent travela in Italy, in ance, in Ireland, and in Walea, gave
him opportunitieafor observation which did not generallyfall to thelot oi medieval
writers in the twelfth and thirteenth centurias, and of these observatione Giraldus
has made due uae. Only exhacta irom these umhses hare been printed before,
and almon all of them are tahan from unique manuscripts.

The Topographis Hibernica (in Vol. V.) is tha result of Giraldua’ two visits to
Ireland. The first in the year llas, the second in llas-s, when ha accompanied
Princo John into that country. Curious as thie treatr'm is, Mr. Dimock is of
opinion that it ought not to be accepted as sober truthful history, ior Girsldna
himself states that truth was not his main object, and that he compiled the work
for the purpose of souuding the praises oflchry the Second. Elsewhere, how·
ever, he declares that he had stated nothing in the Topographia of the truth ot
which he was not well manred, either by his own eyesight or by the testimony,

· with all diligence elicited, of the most tr'ustvorthy and authentic men in the
country ; that though he did not put just the same full luith in their reporta aa
in what he had himself seen, yet, as they only related what they had themselves
seen, he could not but believe such crcdible witnesscs. A very interesting portion
of this trmtiae is devoted to the animala of Ireland It shows that he was a very
accurate and acuta observer, and his descriptione are given iu a way that a
scientiflc naturalist ol the present day could hardly improve upon. The Expug-
natio Hibernica was written about tha year llas aud may be regarded rather
as a great apic thena sober relation of acts occurring iu hie own days. lio
one can perusa it without coming to the conclusion that it ia rather apoetical
fiction than a prosaic truthful history.

Vol. VI. contains tha Itinerarium Kambrie et Descriptio Kambritn: and
Vol. vll, the lires oi S. Remigius and S. Hugh.

This Chronicle, extending from the earliest history of Britain to the year

1154, is juatly the boast ofEngland3 for no other nation can produce any history,

written in its own vernacular, at all approaching it, either in antiquity, truthfnl·

nese, or extent, the historical books of the Bible alone excepted. There are at

present six independeut manuscripts of the Saxon Chronicle, ending in different

years, and written in different parts of the country. In this edition, the text

of each manuscript is printed in columns on the same page, so that the student

may see at a glauce the various changes which occur in orthography, whether

arising from locality or age.

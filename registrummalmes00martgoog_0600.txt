This work derives its principa} salue from being the only contemporaneons
account of the rise oi the Lollards. When written tbe disputesoi' the school-
men had been 1111110110111101101111101011, and they appear both in tha
writings of wycuff aud in those 011111 adversaries. Wycliff’s little bundles
01 tares are not less metaphysical than theological, and the condiet between
Nominalists and Realists rages sideby side with the conflict between the different
interpretem 01 Scriptura. The work gives a good idea 011110 controversias st

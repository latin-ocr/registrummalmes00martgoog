ut Giuucester by Williem the conqueror, iu cuneoli, in order thet he might
know what wus due tc him, in the wey of tex, from his subjecte, end thet euch
et the seme time might know whst he hed tc pey. It was compiled es much
for their protection us ior the benefit of the sovereign. The nobility end people
hed been grievousiy distressed nt the time by the iring bringing over large num·
bers ol French und Bretons‚ und quartering them on his subjecte, ‘⁴ euch uecord-
“ ing to the measure of his lend,” for the purpose ol resisting the invasion of

estete in the time of King Fdwerd; who theu held it ς ite velue in the time of
the late king; end its wniue es it stood at the formation cs the surrey. So
minute wes the surrey, thet the writer oi the contemporary portion of the Sexou ⁸
Chronicle recorda, with some esperity-“So very nerrowly he censedit to be
“ traeed out, that there wes not e single hide, nor one wirgete of lund, nor even.

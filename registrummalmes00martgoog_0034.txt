copied the names as they occurred in the documenta he Ι
was transcribing, but the rubricator frequently gives what

· berewe, ¹Unlrerestret jor Wnkerestret, Wylebrigge for

Wylebrugge, Wrokcshale for Wroexhale, etc. Occasion-

from the Crosa Hayes towards Holloway (late, nowoalled
Silver Street. In another place² the rubricator supplies

The first quolcmtio of 18 leaves has {evidently been
added by an aftcrthought, although the writing is con·
temporary with what follows. For f. 20, the table of
contents, was no doubt originally the commencemsnt‚ and
f. 19 merely a fly leaf. This leaf was, however, subse·
quently written on, anda catchword put at the foot of
f. 18 b. The quaterniones are of 12 leaves, numbered Ι.
to XIIII, but there bas been a little bungling about the
ndmbers. The lest two, f. 278 to f. 299, are not num·
bered. Between Ι. and ΙΙ. six quaterniones, marked Α.
to F, have been inserted. It is these which are referred
to above as having been illuminated by an inferior
artist.

The additional matter, which has been added before
the table of contenta, is printed here as Appendix I.,
while Appendix ΙΙ. consists of documenta inserted

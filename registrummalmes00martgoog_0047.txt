cl. 10³. to the Exchequer, by Henry ΙΙ. The latter was
granted during a visit of the king to Mahnesbury. From
King John the convent obtained two distinct advantages.
The first was the holding of the town and three hundreds
of Malmesbrny, Starkeley and Oheggelow pertaining'
thereto, fora fec-farm of 20l. This was an increase of
tl. 10³. ¹on what the Exchequer had previously received3
· but it must have been a profitable transactiou to the
abbey as well as to the king, as the obtaining of the grant
is mentioned es one of the good decds of abbot Walter
Loeryng. dohn's other grant, the sale of the castle to
the convent for 160 marks to himself and· 37 to his
queen, must have conduoed still more to the well
being not only oi the monks but of the townsmen
also. A fortress had originally been built on the site
ογ King Dyvnwal Moelmyd,l or Dunwallo Molrnucius
as the author of the Eulogium Historiarum calls
him, and was destroyed by a certain king Gurmund.
During the war in king Stepheu's reign it was rebuilt
by Roger bishop of Salisbury‚ and Robert Fitz Hubert,2
who held it fora time, burnt the town. Being within
the precincls of the monastery it was found to be “a
“ serious disgrace and anunspeakable inju1y.'' Of what
kind the injury'was may be inferred from the bull of
Alexander ΙΙΙ., euthorising the abbot to excommunicate
those ol the gerrison who plunder the abbey. By king
John's grant the monks were empowered to pull down
the cestle and do what they pleased with the site, with
one condition, that no other fortress should in future be '⁴
erected The site is now occupied by the Bell inn at

, the west end of the Abbey.

The last of the royal granta is one by Hemy ΙΙΙ.3 ol
free warren in the demesne landa of the convent in Wilts,
which are not within the royal forest of Bradon.

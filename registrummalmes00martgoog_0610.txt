The exact date at which this work was written is,aceording to the chronicler‚
lato. The history isos considerable value as an illmtratiou 01 the period during
which the author lived, and containsa good summaryoi the eventa which followed,
the conquest. This minor chronicle is, however, based on another work (also
written by Matthew Paris) giving fuller details, which has been called the
“Historia Major.” The chronicle here published, uerartlreless, gives some
information not to be found in the greater history.

which, in substance, he adopts. He also mentions, and frequently quotes irem
writers whose works are either entirely lost or at present known only by fragments.

There is to be found, 10 1100 “Book 01 Ilyde,” much informatius relating to the
reign 01 King Alfrad which is not known to exist elsewhere. The volume
contains some curione specimeua 01 Auglo-Saxou and Medinval English.

There is, in this volume, a legendary account of 11ιο peopling ol Ireland and ol
the adventures which belell the various heroes who are said to hare been eou-
nected with Irish history. The details are, however, very meagre both for this
period aud for the time when history becomes more authentia. The plan adopted
iu the chronicle gives the appearance 01 00 accuracy to which the earlier portione
01 the work cannot have any claim. The successiou elevante 10 marked, year by
year, from 0001599 10 an. 1150. The priucipal events narrated in the later
portion 01 1100 worlr are,the invasione 01 foreigners,and the wara 01 the Irish
among themselves. The text hasbeen printed from a MS. preserved iu the
librury 01 Trinity Collega, llublin, written partly iu Latin, partly iu Irish.

The work in its present form, in the editors opiniou‚ira eompumtively modern
version os an undoubtedly ancient original. That it was compiled from conteru-

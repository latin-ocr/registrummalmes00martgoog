On the aeth oi J anuary 1857, the Master 01 tho Rolls
vsubmitted to the 'theasury a proposal lor the publication
ol materiale ior the History of this Country from tlrc
Invasion of the Romans to the reign of Honry VIII.

The Master oi the Rolls suggested that these materials
should be selected for publication under competent
editors without reference to periodical or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer-
ence being given, in the first instance, to such materiale
as were most source and valuable.

He proposed that each elnoniclo or lristorical docu-
ment to be edited should be treated in tho same way as
is the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps ; and
for this purpose the most correct text should be formed
from an accurate collation oi the best MSS.

uo render the work more generally useful, the Master ’
01 the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a
briei account of the lile and times oi the author, and
any¹ remarks necessary to explain the chronology ; but
no other note or comment was to be allowed, except
what might be necessary to establish the correctness of

the text.

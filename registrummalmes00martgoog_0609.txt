This is one 01 the many mediaeval chronicles which assume the character of a
history of the world. It begins with the creation, and is brought down to the
author's ovn time, the reign 01 Ildwurd ΙΠ. hedred to the historical portion, rs
achapter devoted to geography, in which is given a description of every known
land. 'l'u say thet the Polychronicon was written in the lourteenth century is to
say that it is not free frum inaccuracies. It hes, however, a vulne apart from its
intrinsio merita. It enables us to form a very fair estimate 01 the knowledge 01
history and geography which well-informed readers 01 the fourtceuth and flsteenth
centurias possessed, ior it was then the standard worls on general history.

The two English translations, which are printed with the odginal Latin, afford
interesting illustratione 01 the gradnal change of our language, 1οι one was made
in the lourteenth century, the other in the fifteenth. The differences between
'lhevisas version and that 01 the unknown writer are osten considerable.

These two treatisee, though they cannot rank as independent narrativea, are
neverthcless valuable as careful abstracta ol previous histor-iaus, especially “ Le
Livere de Reis de Engletere.” Some vafinus readings are given which ars
interesting to the philologist as instances 01 semi-Saxoniaed French.

Itis supposed that Peter 01 Ickham must have been the author, bnt no certain
conclusion on that point has been arrived at.

The Abbey 01 Meaux was a Cisterclan house, and the work ofits abbat is both
carious and valuable. lt is afaithsul and olleu minute record 01 the establishment
01 a religione community, 01 its progress in forming an ample ravenue, 01 its
struggles to maintain its acquisitione, and of its relations to the governing
institutione 01 the coanuy. In addition to the private affairs 01 the monastery,
some light is thrown upon the public events of the time, which are however lrept
diutina, and appear at the end 01 the history 01 each abbot's administration. The
text har been printed from what is said to be the autograph of the original
compilet, Thomas de Burton, the nineteenth abbot.

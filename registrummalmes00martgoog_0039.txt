Liberties. Among these publio documenrs1 there is a
short French chroniele of the kings of England, from
the landing of Brutus, which ie ascribed to 1200 Bo,
down to the accessiones Edward I. The notioes of the
kings become more meagre aa they approach nearer to
the writer's own time, andare little more than a list,
though for the time before the Conquest a few leading
events are narrated.

Then follows adetailed account2 of the property oi
the abbey in Malmesbury and the neighbourhood in the ·
reign of Edward Ι., 'commenoing with the burgcge‚
londgable, and ehurohscot paid by the townsmen to the
abbey, who held the town of the king in feo-farm for
20l. a year, by granis of King John³ and his Queen
Isabella,4 part of whose dowry it was. Itis most probable
rthat the town itseli was created by the abbey. For in the
grant by bishop Leutheriue of “ terra illa oui vocabulum
est Meoldumesburg,''⁶ there is no mention whatever of
atillo. 'Phe author of the Eulogium Historiarum also
states distinotly that when the Sootoh monlr Meildulf
begged a site for the hermitage, which was the precursor
of the abbey, of the lords of Ingelburne Uestale, there
were few people in the immediate neighbourhood,6 but
that Brokenborough or Kairddreburgh was a town with
a royal residenoe. Looal tradition, which says that Bro-
kenborough is 100 years older than Malmosbury, is pro-
bably approximately correct. In the reign of Eadwi⁷ it
held at least 100 houses, a greater number than Malmes·
buryis credited with in Domesday book, although at
the time the survey was made the relative importanoe of

thetwo places was already reversed. At the present time
Malmesbury isja town oi about 3‚000 inhabitants, standing
